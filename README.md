# User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

# Description 
The goal of this project was to create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for Categories, Products, and Tags.  The application would allow to be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.  

# Challenges
There were many challenges that I faced while creating this project.  One of those challenges was figuring out how to make the put round, so the the data in the database could be updated.  Another challenge was figuring out how to relate the models to eachother.
